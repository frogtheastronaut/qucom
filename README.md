# QUCOM

QUCOM is an open-source SDK for quantum computing simulation in the web. It is written in Rust, which is then compiled to WASM via `wasm-pack` to be used in web applications via CDN or NPM.

It currently offers experimental QASM3 support, with QASM3 parsing and all basic gates implemented.

## Installation
You can install the package via NPM:

`npm install qucom-sdk`

or install via CDN at this link: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qucom-sdk

## Contributing
This is currently a hobby project, though I do have plans to expand it further. I do accept pull requests or issues!
